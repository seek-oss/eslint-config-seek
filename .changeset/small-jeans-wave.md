Migrate to ESLint 9, `@typescript-eslint` 8.

These changes may affect your project setup if you are customising your ESLint configuration. See the individual migration guides:

- https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0
- https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v8


In addition, through these major upgrades, some lint rules have changed or have been renamed. You will likely need to autofix and/or adjust your code after running ESLint. 

As part of this migration, this project has migrated to Flat ESLint configuration. Read the migration guide: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide.
